# ToDoList
This code sets up a to-do list web application with basic styling and functionality. Users can input tasks along with their deadlines, which are then displayed on the webpage. Tasks can be added by clicking the "Enter" button or pressing the Enter key. Each task is shown with its name, date, and a delete button for removal.
